# explaincron

A cli version of **[Crontab guru](https://crontab.guru)**. Because I love crontab.guru, but sometimes whish it had a cli :)
Human readable description of cron schedules.


## TODO
 - ranges where start > stop should not be allowed
 - pipe support
 - print next occurence
 - Support non-standard cron schedules (7 for sunday, @monthly...)
 - colors?
